Executable files in this directory are run to initialise the working directory
for use by etckeeper. If the working directory is not already in version
control, that includes setting up the version control, but not actually
committing anything. If the working directory is in version control,
it includes applying stored metadata to the checked out files in the
working directory.

Please be careful to *never* overwrite existing files/directories
in the working directory (or use absolute care when doing so). If a file
you need to write already exists, check if its contents are sane, and
if not, emit a warning on stderr.

If initialisation fails, exit nonzero and no later files will be run.
